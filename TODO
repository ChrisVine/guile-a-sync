In no particular order:

- Provide some additional wrapper procedures for operations on a glib
  main loop.

- Do we want get_time() to throw a guile exception if clock_gettime()
  returns non-zero?  (This shouldn't really be necessary because
  configure detects whether a monotonic clock is available or not and
  no other exceptional conditions are possible in this usage.)

- Provide unit tests
