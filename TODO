In no particular order:

- Improve documentation (get some automatic documentation generation)

- Switch to SRFI-9 records instead of R6RS records for event-loop objects

- Document how exceptions propagate in relation to the a-sync procedure

- Include more examples in the documentation

- Provide some additional wrapper procedures for operations on a glib
  main loop.
