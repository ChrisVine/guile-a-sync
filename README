This library provides a thread safe event loop for guile
(event-loop.scm) with support for watches on ports/file descriptors,
timeouts, and permits events to be posted by other tasks.  This
includes tasks running on other threads.

It also provides a coroutines interface which provides await semantics
on such events, so as to avoid inversion of control (aka "callback
hell").

See docs/coroutines and docs/event-loop for further details.
