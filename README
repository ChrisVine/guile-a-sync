Overview
--------

This library provides a thread safe event loop for guile
(event-loop.scm) with support for watches on ports/file descriptors
and timeouts, and which permits events to be posted by other tasks.
This includes tasks running on other threads.

It also provides a coroutines interface (coroutines.scm) which
provides await semantics on such events, so as to avoid inversion of
control (aka "callback hell").

See docs/coroutines and docs/event-loop for further details, and the
docs/example.scm file.

Installation
------------

Configure in the ordinary way with something like:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

or on a 64-bit system, probably:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64

On a 64 bit system you may also need to include -fPIC in your CFLAGS
options if libtool doesn't do that for you (libtool normally does when
necessary).

If compiling from git rather than from a release tarball, you will
need to set up the library by running ./autogen.sh before running
configure.
