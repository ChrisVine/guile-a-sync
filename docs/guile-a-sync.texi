This is the guile-a-sync library.  It provides both an asynchronous
event loop for guile-2.0, and coroutines to enable an event loop
(including other event loops such as the glib event loop) to be used
with 'await' semantics to deal with inversion of control -- otherwise
known as ``callback hell''.

General overview
* overview::       General overview of the operation of the library

Modules
* coroutines::     (a-sync coroutines) module - provides coroutines for await semantics on asynchronous events
* event loop::     (a-sync event-loop) module - provides an event loop for asynchronous events, with asynchonous procedures
* sockets::        (a-sync sockets) module - provides asychonous procedures for sockets
* monotonic time:: (a-sync monotonic-time) module - enables monotonic time to be used for timeouts
* gnome glib::     (a-sync gnome-glib) module - provides some convenience await procedures for the glib main loop
* compose::        (a-sync compose) module - provides the compose-a-sync macro interface for the a-sync coroutine
