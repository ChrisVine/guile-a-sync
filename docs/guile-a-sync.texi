This is the guile-a-sync library.  It provides both an asynchronous
event loop for guile, and coroutines to enable an event loop
(including other event loops such as the glib event loop) to be used
with 'await' semantics to deal with inversion of control -- otherwise
known as ``callback hell''.

The guile-a-sync library is provided in five modules:
@menu
* coroutines::     In module (a-sync coroutines) - provides coroutines for await semantics on asynchronous events
* event loop::     In module (a-sync event-loop) - provides an event loop for asynchronous events
* monotonic time:: In module (a-sync monotonic-time) - enables monotonic time to be used for timeouts
* gnome glib::     In module (a-sync gnome-glib) - provides some convenience await procedures for the glib main loop
* compose::        In module (a-sync compose) - provides the compose-a-sync macro interface for the a-sync coroutine
