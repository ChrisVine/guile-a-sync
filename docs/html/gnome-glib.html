<h4 class="node-heading">gnome glib</h4>

<p>When using the scheme (gnome gtk) bindings of guile-gnome with guile,
in order to provide await semantics on gtk+ callbacks it will normally
be necessary to use the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; procedures provided by
the a-sync procedure in the <a href="coroutines.html">(a-sync coroutines)</a>
module directly (calling &rsquo;resume&rsquo; in the gtk+ callback when ready, and
waiting on that callback using &rsquo;await&rsquo;).  However when launching
timeouts, file watches or idle events on the glib main loop,
convenience procedures are possible similar to those provided for the
event loop in the <a href="event-loop.html">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  These
are set out below.
</p>
<p>Note that the g-idle-add procedure in guile-gnome is suspect - there
appears to be a garbage collection issue, and if you call the
procedure often enough in a single or multi-threaded program it will
eventually segfault.  g-io-add-watch is also broken in guile-gnome, so
this library uses its own glib-add-watch procedure which is exported
publicly in case it is useful to users.
</p>
<p>All the other scheme files provided by this library are by default
compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with this
module, so as not to create a hard dependency on guile-gnome.
</p>
<p>The (a-sync gnome-glib) module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-await_002dglib_002dtask_002din_002dthread">Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-task-in-thread</strong> <em>await resume thunk [handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure which will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in its own
thread, and then post an event to the default glib main loop when
&rsquo;thunk&rsquo; has finished.  This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; in the default
glib main loop and will return the thunk&rsquo;s return value.  It is
intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  If
the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is provided, then it will be run in
the default glib main loop if &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; throws and its return value will
be the return value of this procedure; otherwise the program will
terminate if an unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.
&rsquo;handler&rsquo; should take the same arguments as a guile catch handler
(this is implemented using catch).
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs, where the
result of calling &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; will be received.  As mentioned above, the
thunk itself will run in its own thread.
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the worker thread starts), which shouldn&rsquo;t
happen unless memory is exhausted or pthread has run out of resources.
Exceptions arising during execution of the task, if not caught by a
handler procedure, will terminate the program.  Exceptions thrown by
the handler procedure will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.
</p>
<p>This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of await-glib-task-in-thread:
</p><div class="example">

can call a-sync to start another series of asynchronous operations
with a new await-resume pair).  For that reason, await-glib-yield is
usually more convenient for composing asynchronous tasks.  In
retrospect, this procedure offers little over await-glib-yield, apart
from symmetry with await-glib-task-in-thread.

<dt id="index-a_002dsync_002dglib_002dread_002dwatch">Scheme Procedure: <strong>a-sync-glib-read-watch</strong> <em>resume fd proc</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will run &rsquo;proc&rsquo; in the default glib main loop whenever the file
descriptor &rsquo;fd&rsquo; is ready for reading, and apply resume (obtained from
a call to a-sync) to the return value of &rsquo;proc&rsquo;.  &rsquo;proc&rsquo; should take
two arguments, the first of which will be set by glib to the
g-io-channel object constructed for the watch and the second of which
will be set to the GIOCondition (&rsquo;in, &rsquo;hup or &rsquo;err) provided by glib
which caused the watch to activate.  It is intended to be called in a
waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  The watch is multi-shot - it is
for the user to bring it to an end at the right time by calling
g-source-remove in the waitable procedure on the id tag returned by
this procedure.  Any port for the file descriptor &rsquo;fd&rsquo; is not
referenced for garbage collection purposes - it must remain valid
while the read watch is active.  This procedure is mainly intended as
something from which higher-level asynchronous file operations can be
constructed, such as the await-glib-getline procedure.
</p>
<p>File watches in guile-gnome are implemented using a GIOChannel object,
and unfortunately GIOChannel support in guile-gnome is decaying.  The
only procedure that guile-gnome provides to read from a GIOChannel
object is g-io-channel-read-line, which does not work.  One is
therefore usually left with having to read from a guile port (whose
underlying file descriptor is &rsquo;fd&rsquo;) using guile&rsquo;s port input
procedures, but this has its own difficulties because either (i) the
port has to be unbuffered (say by using the open-file or fdopen
procedure with the &rsquo;0&rsquo; mode option or the R6RS open-file-input-port
procedure with a buffer-mode of none, or by calling setvbuf), or (ii)
&rsquo;proc&rsquo; must deal with everything in the port&rsquo;s buffer by calling
drain-input, or by looping on char-ready? before returning.  This is
because otherwise, if the port is buffered, once the port is read from
there may be further characters in the buffer to be dealt with even
though the GIOChannel watch does not trigger because there is nothing
new to make the file descriptor ready for reading.
</p>
<p>Because this procedure takes a &rsquo;resume&rsquo; argument derived from the
a-sync procedure, it must (like the a-sync procedure) in practice be
called in the same thread as that in which the default glib main loop
runs.
</p>
<p>This procedure should not throw an exception unless memory is
exhausted, or guile-glib throws for some other reason.  If &rsquo;proc&rsquo;
throws, say because of port errors, and the exception is not caught
locally, it will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.

if &rsquo;port&rsquo; references a socket, it should be non-blocking for this to
be guaranteed).  It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync, and this procedure is implemented using
a-sync-glib-read-watch.  If an end-of-file object is encountered which
terminates a line of text, a string containing the line of text will
be returned (and from version 0.3, if an end-of-file object is
encountered without any text, the end-of-file object is returned
rather than an empty string).
</p>
<p>For the reasons explained in the documentation on
a-sync-glib-read-watch, this procedure only works correctly if the
port passed to the &rsquo;port&rsquo; argument has buffering switched off (say by
using the open-file, fdopen or duplicate-port procedure with the &rsquo;0&rsquo;
mode option, or by calling setvbuf).  This makes the procedure less
useful than would otherwise be the case.
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the first call to &rsquo;await&rsquo; is made), which
shouldn&rsquo;t happen unless memory is exhausted.  With versions of this
library before 0.13, any exceptions because of read errors or
conversion errors would propagate out of g-main-loop-run and could not
be caught locally.  Having read or conversion errors interfering with
anything using the main loop in this way was not a good approach, so
from version 0.13 of this library all read or conversion exceptions
will propagate in the first instance out of this procedure so that
they may be caught locally, say by putting a catch expression around
the call to this procedure, and only out of g-main-loop-run if not
caught in that way.
</p>
<p>From version 0.6, the bytes comprising the input text will be
converted to their string representation using the encoding of &rsquo;port&rsquo;
if a port encoding has been set, or otherwise using the program&rsquo;s
default port encoding, or if neither has been set using iso-8859-1
(Latin-1).  Exceptions from conversion errors should not arise with
iso-8859-1 encoding, although the string may not necessarily have the
desired meaning for the program concerned if the input encoding is in
fact different.  From version 0.7, this procedure uses the conversion
strategy for &rsquo;port&rsquo; (which defaults at program start-up to
&rsquo;substitute); version 0.6 instead always used a conversion strategy of
&rsquo;error if encountering unconvertible characters).
</p>
<p>From version 0.6, this procedure may be used with an end-of-line
representation of either a line-feed (\n) or a carriage-return and
line-feed (\r\n) combination, as from version 0.6 any carriage return
byte will be discarded (this did not occur with earlier versions).

<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which

input and will return a pair, normally comprising as its car a
bytevector of length &rsquo;size&rsquo; containing the data, and as its cdr the
number of bytes received (which will be the same as &rsquo;size&rsquo; unless an
end-of-file object was encountered part way through receiving the
data).  The event loop will not be blocked by this procedure even if
only individual bytes are available at any one time (although if

</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if an end-of-file object is encountered after

<dt id="index-a_002dsync_002dglib_002dwrite_002dwatch">Scheme Procedure: <strong>a-sync-glib-write-watch</strong> <em>resume fd proc</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will run &rsquo;proc&rsquo; in the default glib main loop whenever the file
descriptor &rsquo;fd&rsquo; is ready for writing, and apply resume (obtained from
a call to a-sync) to the return value of &rsquo;proc&rsquo;.  &rsquo;proc&rsquo; should take
two arguments, the first of which will be set by glib to the
g-io-channel object constructed for the watch and the second of which
will be set to the GIOCondition (&rsquo;out or &rsquo;err) provided by glib which
caused the watch to activate.  It is intended to be called in a
waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  The watch is multi-shot - it is
for the user to bring it to an end at the right time by calling
g-source-remove in the waitable procedure on the id tag returned by
this procedure.  Any port for the file descriptor &rsquo;fd&rsquo; is not
referenced for garbage collection purposes - it must remain valid
while the read watch is active.  This procedure is mainly intended as
something from which higher-level asynchronous file operations can be
constructed.
</p>
<p>The documentation on the a-sync-glib-read-watch procedure comments
about about the difficulties of using GIOChannel file watches with
buffered ports.  The difficulties are not quite so intense with write
watches, but users are likely to get best results by using unbuffered
output ports (say by using the open-file or fdopen procedure with the
&rsquo;0&rsquo; mode option or the R6RS open-file-output-port procedure with a
buffer-mode of none, or by calling setvbuf).
</p>
<p>Because this procedure takes a &rsquo;resume&rsquo; argument derived from the
a-sync procedure, it must (like the a-sync procedure) in practice be
called in the same thread as that in which the default glib main loop
runs.
</p>
<p>This procedure should not throw an exception unless memory is
exhausted, or guile-glib throws for some other reason.  If &rsquo;proc&rsquo;
throws, say because of port errors, and the exception is not caught
locally, it will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.

with buffered output, but if that is done and the port has previously
been used for output by a procedure other than c-write or an
