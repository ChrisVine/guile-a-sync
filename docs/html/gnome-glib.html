<h4 class="node-heading">gnome glib</h4>

<p>When using the scheme (gnome gtk) bindings of guile-gnome with guile,
in order to provide await semantics on gtk+ callbacks it will normally
be necessary to use the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; procedures provided by
the a-sync procedure in the <a href="coroutines.html#coroutines">(a-sync coroutines)</a>
module directly (calling &rsquo;resume&rsquo; in the gtk+ callback when ready, and
waiting on that callback using &rsquo;await&rsquo;).  However when launching
timeouts, file watches or idle events on the glib main loop,
convenience procedures are possible similar to those provided for the
event loop in the <a href="event-loop.html#event-loop">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  These
are set out below.
</p>
<p>Note that the g-idle-add procedure in guile-gnome is suspect - there
appears to be a garbage collection issue, and if you call the
procedure often enough in a single or multi-threaded program it will
eventually segfault.  g-io-add-watch is also broken in guile-gnome, so
this library uses its own glib-add-watch procedure which is exported
publicly in case it is useful to users.
</p>
<p>All the other scheme files provided by this library are by default
compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with this
module, so as not to create a hard dependency on guile-gnome.
</p>
<p>The (a-sync gnome-glib) module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dglib_002dtask_002din_002dthread"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-task-in-thread</strong> <em>await resume thunk [handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure which will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in its own
thread, and then post an event to the default glib main loop when
&rsquo;thunk&rsquo; has finished.  This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; in the default
glib main loop and will return the thunk&rsquo;s return value.  It is
intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  If
the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is provided, then it will be run in
the default glib main loop if &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; throws and its return value will
be the return value of this procedure; otherwise the program will
terminate if an unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.
&rsquo;handler&rsquo; should take the same arguments as a guile catch handler
(this is implemented using catch).
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs, where the
result of calling &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; will be received.  As mentioned above, the
thunk itself will run in its own thread.
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the worker thread starts), which shouldn&rsquo;t
happen unless memory is exhausted or pthread has run out of resources.
Exceptions arising during execution of the task, if not caught by a
handler procedure, will terminate the program.  Exceptions thrown by
the handler procedure will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.
</p>
<p>This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of await-glib-task-in-thread:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))

<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for running generator procedures
asynchronously.  The &rsquo;generator&rsquo; argument is a procedure taking one
argument, namely a yield argument (see the documentation on the

cause &rsquo;proc&rsquo; to execute in the default glib main loop.
</p>
<p>&rsquo;proc&rsquo; should be a procedure taking a single argument, namely the
value yielded by the generator.  If the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is
provided, then that handler will be run in the default glib main loop
if &rsquo;generator&rsquo; throws; otherwise the program will terminate if an
unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;generator&rsquo;.  &rsquo;handler&rsquo; should
take the same arguments as a guile catch handler (this is implemented
using catch).
</p>
<p>This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and will return when the generator has
finished or, if &rsquo;handler&rsquo; is provided, upon the generator throwing an
exception.  This procedure will return #f if the generator completes
normally, or &rsquo;guile-a-sync-thread-error if the generator throws an
exception and &rsquo;handler&rsquo; is run.

<dt><a name="index-glib_002dadd_002dwatch"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>glib-add-watch</strong> <em>ioc cond func [context]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure replaces guile-gnome&rsquo;s g-io-add-watch procedure, which
won&rsquo;t compile.  It attaches a watch on a g-io-channel object to the
main context provided, or if none is provided, to the default glib
main context (the main program loop).  It returns a glib ID which can
be passed subsequently to the g-source-remove procedure.  It should be
possible to call this procedure in any thread.
</p>
<p>&rsquo;ioc&rsquo; is the g-io-condition object to which the watch is to be
attached, and &rsquo;cond&rsquo; is a list of symbols (being &rsquo;in, &rsquo;out, &rsquo;pri,
&rsquo;hup, &rsquo;err and &rsquo;nval) comprising the events for which the watch is
established.
</p>
<p>&rsquo;func&rsquo; is executed when an event occurs, and takes two arguments:
first the g-io-channel object to which the watch has been attached,
and second a g-io-condition object indicating the watch condition
which has been met (note: the interface for g-io-condition objects is
broken in guile-gnome at present).  The watch is ended either by
&rsquo;func&rsquo; returning #f, or by applying g-source-remove to the return
value of this procedure.  Otherwise the watch will continue.

<dt><a name="index-a_002dsync_002dglib_002dread_002dwatch"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>a-sync-glib-read-watch</strong> <em>resume fd proc</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will run &rsquo;proc&rsquo; in the default glib main loop whenever the file
descriptor &rsquo;fd&rsquo; is ready for reading, and apply resume (obtained from
a call to a-sync) to the return value of &rsquo;proc&rsquo;.  &rsquo;proc&rsquo; should take
two arguments, the first of which will be set by glib to the
g-io-channel object constructed for the watch and the second of which
will be set to the GIOCondition (&rsquo;in, &rsquo;hup or &rsquo;err) provided by glib
which caused the watch to activate.  It is intended to be called in a
waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  The watch is multi-shot - it is
for the user to bring it to an end at the right time by calling
g-source-remove in the waitable procedure on the id tag returned by
this procedure.  Any port for the file descriptor &rsquo;fd&rsquo; is not
referenced for garbage collection purposes - it must remain valid
while the read watch is active.  This procedure is mainly intended as
something from which higher-level asynchronous file operations can be
constructed, such as the await-glib-getline procedure.
</p>
<p>File watches in guile-gnome are implemented using a GIOChannel object,
and unfortunately GIOChannel support in guile-gnome is decaying.  The
only procedure that guile-gnome provides to read from a GIOChannel
object is g-io-channel-read-line, which does not work.  One is
therefore usually left with having to read from a guile port (whose
underlying file descriptor is &rsquo;fd&rsquo;) using guile&rsquo;s port input
procedures, but this has its own difficulties because either (i) the
port has to be unbuffered (say by using the open-file or fdopen
procedure with the &rsquo;0&rsquo; mode option or the R6RS open-file-input-port
procedure with a buffer-mode of none, or by calling setvbuf), or (ii)
&rsquo;proc&rsquo; must deal with everything in the port&rsquo;s buffer by calling
drain-input, or by looping on char-ready? before returning.  This is
because otherwise, if the port is buffered, once the port is read from
there may be further characters in the buffer to be dealt with even
though the GIOChannel watch does not trigger because there is nothing
new to make the file descriptor ready for reading.
</p>
<p>Because this procedure takes a &rsquo;resume&rsquo; argument derived from the
a-sync procedure, it must (like the a-sync procedure) in practice be
called in the same thread as that in which the default glib main loop
runs.
</p>
<p>This procedure should not throw an exception unless memory is
exhausted, or guile-glib throws for some other reason.  If &rsquo;proc&rsquo;
throws, say because of port errors, and the exception is not caught
locally, it will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.
</p>
<p>As an example of how to use a-sync-glib-read-watch, here is the

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dglib_002dgetline"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-getline</strong> <em>await resume port</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will start a read watch on &rsquo;port&rsquo; for a line of input.  It calls
&rsquo;await&rsquo; while waiting for input and will return the line of text
received (without the terminating &rsquo;\n&rsquo; character).  The event loop
will not be blocked by this procedure even if only individual
characters are available at any one time.  It is intended to be called
in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync, and this procedure is
implemented using a-sync-glib-read-watch.  If an end-of-file object is
encountered which terminates a line of text, a string containing the
line of text will be returned (and from version 0.3, if an end-of-file
object is encountered without any text, the end-of-file object is
returned rather than an empty string).
</p>
<p>For the reasons explained in the documentation on
a-sync-glib-read-watch, this procedure only works correctly if the
port passed to the &rsquo;port&rsquo; argument has buffering switched off.  This
makes the procedure less useful than would otherwise be the case.
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the first call to &rsquo;await&rsquo; is made), which
shouldn&rsquo;t happen unless memory is exhausted.  Subsequent exceptions
(say, because of port or conversion errors) will propagate out of
g-main-loop-run.
</p>
<p>From version 0.6, the bytes comprising the input text will be
converted to their string representation using the encoding of &rsquo;port&rsquo;
if a port encoding has been set, or otherwise using the program&rsquo;s
default port encoding, or if neither has been set using iso-8859-1
(Latin-1).  Exceptions from conversion errors will, as mentioned,
propagate out of g-main-loop-run.  Conversion errors should not arise
with iso-8859-1 encoding, although the string may not necessarily have
the desired meaning for the program concerned if the input encoding is
in fact different.  From version 0.7, this procedure uses the
conversion strategy for &rsquo;port&rsquo; (which defaults at program start-up to
&rsquo;substitute); version 0.6 instead always used a conversion strategy of
&rsquo;error if encountering unconvertible characters).
</p>
<p>From version 0.6, this procedure may be used with an end-of-line
representation of either a line-feed (\n) or a carriage-return and
line-feed (\r\n) combination, as from version 0.6 any carriage return
byte will be discarded (this did not occur with earlier versions).

output ports (say by using the open-file or fdopen procedure with the
&rsquo;0&rsquo; mode option or the R6RS open-file-output-port procedure with a
buffer-mode of none, or by calling setvbuf).
</p>
<p>Because this procedure takes a &rsquo;resume&rsquo; argument derived from the
a-sync procedure, it must (like the a-sync procedure) in practice be
called in the same thread as that in which the default glib main loop
runs.
</p>
<p>This procedure should not throw an exception unless memory is
exhausted, or guile-glib throws for some other reason.  If &rsquo;proc&rsquo;
throws, say because of port errors, and the exception is not caught
locally, it will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.
