<h4 class="node-heading">gnome glib</h4>

<p>When using the scheme (gnome gtk) bindings of guile-gnome with guile,
in order to provide await semantics on gtk+ callbacks it will normally
be necessary to use the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; procedures provided by
the a-sync procedure in the <a href="coroutines.html#coroutines">(a-sync coroutines)</a>
module directly (calling &rsquo;resume&rsquo; in the gtk+ callback when ready, and
waiting on that callback using &rsquo;await&rsquo;).  However when launching
timeouts, file watches or idle events on the glib main loop,
convenience procedures are possible similar to those provided for the
event loop in the <a href="event-loop.html#event-loop">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  These
are set out below.
</p>
<p>Note that the g-idle-add procedure in guile-gnome is suspect - there
appears to be a garbage collection issue, and if you call the
procedure often enough in a single or multi-threaded program it will
eventually segfault.  g-io-add-watch is also broken in guile-gnome, so
this library uses its own glib-add-watch procedure which is exported
publicly in case it is useful to users.
</p>
<p>All the other scheme files provided by this library are by default
compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with this
module, so as not to create a hard dependency on guile-gnome.
</p>
<p>The (a-sync gnome-glib) module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dglib_002dtask_002din_002dthread"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-task-in-thread</strong> <em>await resume thunk [handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure which will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in its own
thread, and then post an event to the default glib main loop when
&rsquo;thunk&rsquo; has finished.  This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and will return
the thunk&rsquo;s return value.  It is intended to be called in a waitable
procedure invoked by a-sync.  If the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is
provided, then it will be run in the event loop thread if &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;
throws and its return value will be the return value of this
procedure; otherwise the program will terminate if an unhandled
exception propagates out of &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.  &rsquo;handler&rsquo; should take the same
arguments as a guile catch handler (this is implemented using catch).
If &rsquo;handler&rsquo; throws, the exception will propagate out of
g-mail-loop-run.
</p>
<p>This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.
</p>
<p>Here is an example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (simple-format #t &quot;1 + 1 is ~A\n&quot;
			 (await-glib-task-in-thread await resume
						    (lambda ()
						      (+ 1 1))))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dglib_002dtask"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-task</strong> <em>await resume thunk</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with glib, which will run
&rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in the default glib main loop.  This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo;
and will return the thunk&rsquo;s return value.  It is intended to be called
in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  It is the single-threaded
corollary of await-glib-task-in-thread.  This means that (unlike with
await-glib-task-in-thread) while &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; is running other events in
the main loop will not make progress.  This is not particularly useful
except when called by the main loop thread for the purpose of bringing
the loop to an end at its own place in the event queue, or when called
by a worker thread to report a result expected by a waitable procedure
running in the main loop thread.  (For the latter case though,
await-glib-task-in-thread is generally a more convenient wrapper.)
</p>
<p>This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.
</p>
<p>Here is an example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (simple-format #t &quot;1 + 1 is ~A\n&quot;
			 (await-glib-task await resume
					  (lambda ()
					    (+ 1 1))))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dglib_002dtimeout"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-timeout</strong> <em>await resume msec thunk</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in the default glib main loop when the timeout
expires.  This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and will return the thunk&rsquo;s
return value.  It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync.  The timeout is single shot only - as soon as
&rsquo;thunk&rsquo; has run once and completed, the timeout will be removed from
the event loop.
</p>
<p>Here is an example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (simple-format #t
			 &quot;Timeout ~A\n&quot;
			 (await-glib-timeout await resume
					     100
					     (lambda ()
					       &quot;expired&quot;)))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-glib_002dadd_002dwatch"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>glib-add-watch</strong> <em>ioc cond func [context]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure replaces guile-gnome&rsquo;s g-io-add-watch procedure, which
won&rsquo;t compile.  It attaches a watch on a g-io-channel object to the
main context provided, or if none is provided, to the default glib
main context (the main program loop).  It returns a glib ID which can
be passed subsequently to the g-source-remove procedure.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-a_002dsync_002dglib_002dread_002dwatch"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>a-sync-glib-read-watch</strong> <em>resume port proc</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will run &rsquo;proc&rsquo; in the default glib main loop whenever &rsquo;port&rsquo; is ready
for reading, and apply resume (obtained from a call to a-sync) to the
return value of &rsquo;proc&rsquo;.  &rsquo;proc&rsquo; should take two arguments, the first
of which will be set by glib to the g-io-channel object constructed
for the watch and the second of which will be set to the GIOCondition
(&rsquo;in, &rsquo;pri, &rsquo;hup or &rsquo;err) provided by glib which caused the watch to
activate.  It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked
by a-sync.  The watch is multi-shot - it is for the user to bring it
to an end at the right time by calling g-source-remove in the waitable
procedure on the id tag returned by this procedure.  The revealed
count of the file descriptor underlying the port is incremented, and
it is also for the programmer, when removing the watch, to call
release-port-handle on the port.  This procedure is mainly intended as
something from which higher-level asynchronous file operations can be
constructed, such as the await-glib-getline procedure.
</p>
<p>As an example of how to use a-sync-glib-read-watch, here is the
implementation of await-glib-getline:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define (await-glib-getline await resume port)
  (define text '())
  (define id (a-sync-glib-read-watch resume
				     port
				     (lambda (ioc status)
				       (if (or (eq? status 'pri)
					       (eq? status 'err))
					   #f
					   (let next ()
					     (let ((ch (read-char port)))
					       (if (not (or (eof-object? ch)
							    (char=? ch #\newline)))
						   (begin
						     (set! text (cons ch text))
						     (if (char-ready? port)
							 (next)
							 'more))
						   (reverse-list-&gt;string text))))))))
  (let next ((res (await)))
    (if (eq? res 'more)
	(next (await))
	(begin
	  (g-source-remove id)
	  (release-port-handle port)
	  res))))
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dglib_002dgetline"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-getline</strong> <em>await resume port</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will start a file watch and run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in the default glib main loop
whenver an entire line of text has been received.  This procedure
calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; while waiting for input and will return the line of text
received (without the terminating &rsquo;\n&rsquo; character).  The event loop
will not be blocked by this procedure even if only individual
characters are available at any one time.  It is intended to be called
in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  This procedure is
implemented using a-sync-glib-read-watch.  If an exceptional condition
(&rsquo;pri) or an error (&rsquo;err) is encountered, #f will be returned.
</p>
<p>Here is an example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
          (display &quot;Enter a line of text at the keyboard\n&quot;)
          (simple-format #t
                         &quot;The line was: ~A\n&quot;
                         (await-glib-getline await resume
					     (open &quot;/dev/tty&quot; O_RDONLY)))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-a_002dsync_002dglib_002dwrite_002dwatch"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>a-sync-glib-write-watch</strong> <em>resume port proc</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will run &rsquo;proc&rsquo; in the default glib main loop whenever &rsquo;port&rsquo; is ready
for writing, and apply resume (obtained from a call to a-sync) to the
return value of &rsquo;proc&rsquo;.  &rsquo;proc&rsquo; should take two arguments, the first
