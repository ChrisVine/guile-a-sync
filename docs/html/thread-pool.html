<h4 class="node-heading">thread pool</h4>

<p>This (a-sync thread-pool) module supplements the <a href="event-loop.html#event-loop">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  (a-sync event-loop) provides
asynchronous procedures which can wait on the completion of a task
running in a worker thread or on an event loop running in another
thread.  However, sometimes it is better to run tasks in a thread pool
rather than launching worker threads, particularly where the workload
suits having the number of threads in the thread pool approximating to
the number of local processors available to the program.  (In guile,
the number of processors so available can be obtained using the
current-processor-count procedure.)
</p>
<p>This (a-sync thread-pool) module provides such a thread pool, together
with two asynchronous procedures (await-task-in-thread-pool! and
await-generator-in-thread-pool!) which can wait in an event loop for a
task on the thread pool to complete and provide its result.
</p>
<p>The thread pool objects provided by this module do not make provision
for rate limiting similar to that provided by the event loops in the
<a href="event-loop.html#event-loop">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  This is because there
is no one-size-fits-all way of doing so.  One common approach is, as
in the case of the event loops provided by this library, to apply
throttling to threads which add tasks by enforcing a wait in their
thread of execution when the level of queued tasks reaches too high a
level, so hindering their ability to add new ones.  However this is
counter productive where it is a task running on the thread pool which
is adding the new tasks, particularly with a thread pool having only a
few threads running in its pool.  Another approach is to throw an
exception when adding tasks which exceed a user-selectable level.
</p>
<p>The best approach is for user code to provide its own rate limiting in
cases where the way that that code is organised means that it could
produce an excessive number of accumulating unexecuted tasks in the
thread pool, possibly by applying delays when unexecuted tasks rise in
number excessively, using timeouts with an event loop. This may be
checked for by having code call the thread-pool-get-num-tasks
procedure before adding a significant batch of new tasks in order to
test queue size, and if necessary postpone adding the new tasks until
the size of the already accumulated tasks has reduced.
</p>
<p>This module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-make_002dthread_002dpool"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-thread-pool</strong> <em>#:key max-threads min-threads idle non-blocking</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure constructs a thread pool object of native OS threads.
It takes four optional arguments.  The #:max-thread keyname specifies
the maximum number of threads which will run in the pool, and the
default value is 8.  The #:min-threads keyname specifies the minimum
number of persistent threads which will run in the pool and will not
be subject to an #:idle timeout, and the default value is 0.  It is an
error if #:min-threads is greater than #:max-threads.
</p>
<p>Thread pool objects with a #:min-threads setting of greater than 0 are
usually best kept as top level objects, because the minimum value of
threads will keep alive in the pool until thread-pool-stop! is called.
If such a thread pool is constructed within a local lexical scope,
then either thread-pool-stop! must be applied to the pool before that
scope is exited, or the last task added to the pool should itself
apply thread-pool-stop! to the pool (which it can do if &rsquo;non-blocking&rsquo;
is #t).  Otherwise, the minimum value of threads will remain alive
uselessly in blocked condition in the pool until the program
terminates, even though the pool may be inaccessible.
</p>
<p>The #:idle keyname specifies the length of time in milliseconds that
threads greater in number than #:min-threads and not executing any
tasks will remain in existence.  The default is 5000 (5 seconds).
</p>
<p>The #:non-blocking keyname affects the operation of the
thread-pool-stop! procedure.  When set to #f, which is the default,
that procedure will not return until all tasks previously added to the
pool have completed.  If set to #t, the thread-pool-stop! procedure
will return immediately, before all tasks have finished.
</p>
<p>The #:max-threads, #:non-blocking and #:idle settings may subsequently
be altered by applying the thread-pool-change-max-threads!,
thread-pool-set-non-blocking! or thread-pool-set-idle-time! procedure
to the pool.
</p>
<p>This procedure will throw an exception if the system is unable to
start the number of threads given as the #:min-threads argument.  In
such a case, any threads which have in fact started in the pool will
be killed.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-thread_002dpool_003f"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool?</strong> <em>obj</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure indicates whether &rsquo;obj&rsquo; is a thread pool object
constructed by make-thread-pool.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-thread_002dpool_002dget_002dnum_002dtasks"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-get-num-tasks</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure returns the number of tasks which the thread pool
object is at present either running in the pool or has queued for
execution.  This procedure will not throw.  It is also thread safe,
although it accesses the task number field outside the pool mutex and
therefore with relaxed memory ordering.  That enables this procedure
to be applied more efficiently for rate limiting purposes but the
result might at any one time be marginally out of date.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-thread_002dpool_002dget_002dmax_002dthreads"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-get-max-threads</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure returns the current maximum number of threads set for
the thread pool.
</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it).
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-thread_002dpool_002dchange_002dmax_002dthreads_0021"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-change-max-threads!</strong> <em>pool delta</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure will increase, or if &rsquo;delta&rsquo; is negative reduce, the
maximum number of threads which the thread pool object will currently
run by the value of &rsquo;delta&rsquo;.  The main purpose of this is to enable a
task to increment the maximum thread number where it is about to enter
a call which may block (non-asynchronously) for some time, with a view
to decrementing it later when it has finished making blocking calls,
so as to enable another thread to keep a core active.  A
with-thread-pool-increment macro is available which will do this for
you automatically in an exception-safe way (see the documentation on
that macro below).
</p>
<p>If &rsquo;delta&rsquo; is negative and results in a max_threads value of less than
the current number of running threads, the number of threads actually
running will only be reduced as tasks complete, or as idle timeouts
expire.  This procedure does nothing if thread-pool-stop! has
previously been called.  This procedure is thread safe - any thread
may call it.
</p>
<p>If &rsquo;delta&rsquo; is positive and tasks are currently queued for execution, a
new thread or threads will be started for the queued tasks.  This
procedure may therefore throw an exception if the system is unable to
start the required new thread(s).
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-thread_002dpool_002dget_002dnon_002dblocking"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-get-non-blocking</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>

pool.  (See the documentation on the thread-pool-stop!  procedure for
more information about what that means.)

<dd><p>This procedure sets the non-blocking status of the thread pool.  (See
the documentation on the thread-pool-stop!  procedure for more
information about what that means.)
</p>

<dd><p>This procedure returns the current idle time setting for the thread
pool, in milliseconds.
</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it).

<dd><p>This procedure sets the current idle time for the thread pool, namely
the length of time in milliseconds that threads greater in number than
the minimum and not executing any tasks will remain in existence
waiting for new tasks.  This will only have effect for threads in the
pool which begin waiting for new tasks after this procedure is called.
</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it).
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-thread_002dpool_002dstop_0021"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-stop!</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure will cause the thread-pool object to stop running
tasks.  However, all tasks already running or queued for execution
will be permitted to execute and complete normally.  If the
thread-pool&rsquo;s non-blocking setting is set to #f, this procedure will
wait until all the tasks still to execute have finished before
returning, and if #t it will return straight away.
</p>
<p>After this procedure has been called, any attempt to add further tasks
with the thread-pool-add! procedure will fail, and that procedure will
throw a &rsquo;thread-pool-error exception.  The same exception will be
thrown if this procedure is applied to a thread pool to which this
procedure has previously been applied.
</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it) unless the
non-blocking setting is #f, in which case no task running on the
thread-pool object may call this procedure.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-thread_002dpool_002dadd_0021"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-add!</strong> <em>pool task [fail-handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure adds a new task to the thread pool.  &rsquo;task&rsquo; must be a
thunk.  If one or more threads in the pool are currently blocking and
waiting for a task, then the task will begin executing immediately in
one of the threads.  If not, and the the number of threads running in
the pool is less than the value returned by
thread-pool-get-max-threads, a new thread will start and the task will
execute immediately in the new thread.  Otherwise, the task will be
queued for execution as soon as a thread becomes available. Tasks will
be executed in the order in which they are added to the thread pool
object.  This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it,
including any task running on the thread pool object).
</p>
<p>An optional handler procedure may be passed to &rsquo;fail-handler&rsquo; which
will be invoked if the task throws an exception.  If a task throws
an exception and no handler procedure is provided, the program will
terminate.  The &rsquo;fail-handler&rsquo; procedure will be passed the same
arguments as if it were a guile catch handler (it is implemented
using catch).
</p>
<p>If this procedure starts a new thread (see above), it may throw an
exception if the system is unable to start the thread correctly.  This
procedure will throw a &rsquo;thread-pool-error exception if it is invoked
after the thread pool object concerned has been closed by a call to
thread-pool-stop!.
</p>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.

<dt><a name="index-_0028with_002dthread_002dpool_002dincrement"></a>Syntax: <strong>(with-thread-pool-increment</strong> <em>pool body0 body1 ...)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This macro is intended to be called by a task running on a thread pool
which is about to make a blocking (non-asynchronous) call.  It will
increment the max-threads value of &rsquo;pool&rsquo; by 1 (by calling
thread-pool-change-max-threads!) so as to enable a queued task to keep
a core active, and decrement it again when execution of the body
clauses has completed.
</p>
<p>The (i) increment, (ii) execution of body clauses, and (iii)
decrement, form the three branches of a dynamic-wind, so the decrement
automatically occurs if control leaves body execution because of an
exception or other jump.
</p>
<p>This macro is first available in version 0.18 of this library.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dtask_002din_002dthread_002dpool_0021"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-task-in-thread-pool!</strong> <em>await resume [loop] pool thunk [handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional.  The procedure will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in
the thread pool specified by the &rsquo;pool&rsquo; argument.  The result of
executing &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; will then be posted to the event loop specified by
the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument, or to the default event loop if no &rsquo;loop&rsquo;
argument is provided or if #f is provided as the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument
(pattern matching is used to detect the type of the third argument),
and will comprise this procedure&rsquo;s return value.  This procedure is
intended to be called within a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync
(which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).  It will normally
be necessary to call event-loop-block! on &rsquo;loop&rsquo; (or on the default
event loop) before invoking this procedure.
</p>
<p>If the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is provided, then that handler will
run if &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; throws, and the return value of the handler would
become the return value of this procedure; otherwise the program will
terminate if an unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.  Note
that unlike a handler passed to the thread-pool-add!  procedure,
&rsquo;handler&rsquo; will run in the event loop thread and not in a thread pool
thread.  Exceptions thrown by the handler procedure will propagate out
of event-loop-run! for the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; event loop.
</p>
<p>This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and must (like the a-sync procedure) be
called in the same thread as that in which the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; or default event
loop runs (as the case may be).
</p>
<p>This procedure calls event-post! in the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; event loop, which could
be subject to throttling (see the documentation for the
make-event-loop procedure for further information).
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up, which shouldn&rsquo;t happen unless the thread pool given by the
&rsquo;pool&rsquo; argument has been closed (in which case a &rsquo;thread-pool-error
exception will arise), the thread pool tries to start an additional
native thread which the operating system fails to supply (which would
cause a system exception to arise) or memory is exhausted.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of await-task-in-thread-pool!:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(set-default-event-loop!) ;; if none has yet been set
(let ((pool (make-thread-pool #:max-threads 4)))

						       pool
						       (lambda ()
							 (+ 1 1))))
	    (event-loop-quit!))))
(event-loop-block! #t) ;; because the task runs in another thread
(event-loop-run!)
</pre></div>
<p>This procedure is first available in version 0.18 of this library.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-await_002dgenerator_002din_002dthread_002dpool_0021"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-generator-in-thread-pool!</strong> <em>await resume [loop] pool generator proc [handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>The loop argument is optional.  The &rsquo;generator&rsquo; argument is a
procedure taking one argument, namely a yield argument (see the
documentation on the make-iterator procedure for further details).
This await-generator-in-pool procedure will cause &rsquo;generator&rsquo; to run
as a task in the &rsquo;pool&rsquo; thread pool, and whenever &rsquo;generator&rsquo; yields a
value this will cause &rsquo;proc&rsquo; to execute in the event loop specified by
the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument, or in the default event loop if no &rsquo;loop&rsquo;
argument is provided or if #f is provided as the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument.
&rsquo;proc&rsquo; should be a procedure taking a single argument, namely the
value yielded by the generator.
</p>
<p>This procedure is intended to be called within a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).
It will normally be necessary to call event-loop-block! on &rsquo;loop&rsquo; (or
on the default event loop) before invoking this procedure.
</p>
<p>If the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is provided, then that handler will
run if &rsquo;generator&rsquo; throws an exception; otherwise the program will
terminate if an unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;generator&rsquo;.
Note that unlike a handler passed to the thread-pool-add! procedure,
&rsquo;handler&rsquo; will run in the event loop thread and not in a thread pool
thread.  This procedure will return #f if the generator completes
normally, or &rsquo;guile-a-sync-thread-error if the generator throws an
exception and &rsquo;handler&rsquo; is run (the &rsquo;guile-a-sync-thread-error symbol
is reserved to the implementation and should not be yielded by the
generator).  Exceptions thrown by the handler procedure will propagate
out of event-loop-run! for the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; event loop.
</p>
<p>This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and will return when the generator has
finished or, if &rsquo;handler&rsquo; is provided, upon the generator raising an
exception.  This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called
in the same thread as that in which the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; or default event loop
runs (as the case may be).
</p>
<p>This procedure calls event-post! in both the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; event loop, which
could be subject to throttling (see the documentation for the
make-event-loop procedure for further information).
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up, which shouldn&rsquo;t happen unless the thread loop given by the
&rsquo;pool&rsquo; argument has been closed (in which case an &rsquo;thread-pool-error
exception will arise), the thread pool tries to start an additional
native thread which the operating system fails to supply (which would
cause a system exception to arise) or memory is exhausted.  Exceptions
arising during the execution of &rsquo;proc&rsquo;, if not caught locally, will
propagate out of event-loop-run! for &rsquo;loop&rsquo; or the default event loop
(as the case may be).
</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of await-generator-in-thread-pool!:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(set-default-event-loop!) ;; if none has yet been set
(let ((pool (make-thread-pool #:max-threads 4)))
  (a-sync (lambda (await resume)

					     pool
					     (lambda (yield)
					       (let loop ((count 0))
						 (when (&lt; count 5)
						   (yield (* 2 count))
						   (loop (1+ count)))))
					     (lambda (val)
					       (display val)
					       (newline)))
	    (event-loop-block! #f))))
(event-loop-block! #t) ;; because the generator runs in another thread
